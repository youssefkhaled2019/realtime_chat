Install Redis (Required to send payloads to multiple clients at once)

Redis does not work "out of the box" on windows. There is a number of ways to get it working but by far the easiest is to use Menurai.

    Just download the executable and run it.
    Update settings with CHANNEL_LAYERS configuration in settings.py

    CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer',
            'CONFIG': {
                "hosts": [('127.0.0.1', 6379)],
            },
        },
    }
