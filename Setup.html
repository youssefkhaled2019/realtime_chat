Getting Started Guide

A guide to creating a new django project that uses:

    windows
    python3.8.2
    pip
    django 2.2.15 (LTS)
    virtualenv
    Redis
    django channels 2
    Postgres

Install Python3.8.2

Bottom of page: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/
Installing pip

    https://pypi.org/project/pip/
    Open cmd prompt
    pip install pip

Setup virtualenv

    Navigate to where you want to keep your django projects. I use D://DjangoProjects/
    Create D://DjangoProjects/ChatServerPlayground folder or whatever you want to name the project.
    Create a virtual environment to run the project in.
        Typically I call it "venv" but you can call it something else if you like. Doesn't matter. djangoproject_venv for example.
        python -m venv venv or python -m venv djangoproject_venv if you like
    Open a cmd prompt in your project directly
    Navigate into venv folder
        cd venv
    Activate the virtual environment
        Windows: Scripts\activate
        Linux: source bin/activate
        Mac (I think): source bin/activate

Install Django and create Django project

    Install django
        python -m pip install Django==2.2.15
        See LTS: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/
    Create the django project
        django-admin startproject ChatServerPlayground
    Rename root directory (ChatServerPlayground) to src
        I prefer to name my root directory src because inside the project is another folder named ChatServerPlayground or whatever you called your project
        So now you should have the following folder structure:
            D://DjangoProjects/ChatServerPlayground/venv/src/
                Inside src you will have a folder name ChatServerPlayground and a manage.py file
    Keep track of the libraries you use
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
    Run the server to make sure it's working
        python manage.py runserver
    Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Postgres Setup (Windows)

Postgres needs to run as a service on your machine. Since I'm using windows I will show you how to do this on windows. When we launch this website in production at the end of the course I'll show you how to setup postgres on Linux.

    Download postgres: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
        I am using x86-64 version 10 for windows
    run the .exe file and go through the installation
        remember the superuser password you use. This is very important.
        port 5432 is the standard
    After installation confirm the service is running by opening the "Services" window on windows.
        If it's not running then start it
    Confirm you have access to database
        open cmd prompt
        write psql postgres postgres
            means: "connect to the database named 'postgres' with the user 'postgres'". 'postgres' is the default root user name for the database.
    Some commands you'll find useful:
        List databases
            \l
        Connect to a different database
            \c codingwithmitch_chat
            Keep in mind you will not have any other databases. We will create one in a second.
        List the tables in a database \dt
        create a new database for our project
            CREATE DATABASE codingwithmitch_chat_dev;
        Create a new user that has permissions to use that database
            CREATE USER django WITH PASSWORD 'password';
            These credentials are important to remember because they are used in the django postgres configuration.
        List all users
            /du
        Give the new user all privileges on new db
            GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE codingwithmitch_chat_dev TO django;
        Test
            disconnect from db
                \q
            Connect to the db with user
                psql codingwithmitch_chat_dev django

Django and Postgres Setup

    Install psycopg2
        pip install psycopg2
    Add to requirements
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
    Update settings.py with the following postgres configuration

    DB_NAME = "codingwithmitch_chat_dev"
    DB_USER = "django"
    DB_PASSWORD = "password"
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
            'NAME': DB_NAME,
            'USER': DB_USER,
            'PASSWORD': DB_PASSWORD,
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }

    Delete the sqlite database in project root
    migrate to commit changes to database
        python manage.py migrate
    create a superuser
        python manage.py createsuperuser
    log into admin
        python manage.py runserver
        visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
        This confirms the database is working correctly.

Install Redis (Required to send payloads to multiple clients at once)

Redis does not work "out of the box" on windows. There is a number of ways to get it working but by far the easiest is to use Menurai.

    Links:
        download: https://www.memurai.com/get-memurai
        docs: https://docs.memurai.com/en/installation.html
    Just download the executable and run it.
    Update settings with CHANNEL_LAYERS configuration in settings.py

    CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer',
            'CONFIG': {
                "hosts": [('127.0.0.1', 6379)],
            },
        },
    }
